# GacarCrypt
GacarCrypt is a simple file/text encryption program written in python
It allows simple file/text encryption/decryption in AES and RSA, RSA key pair generation and signature making/verification.
It includes advanced features of splitting text file, encrypting different parts of that file with different keys. This is set to be used in circumstances where a file contains information for diffrent levels of secrecy. Currently only supporting AES
This Program is written as a homework project so code quality must be very garbage, so please take my apology.
